LoRa radios are used in a variety of network types, each designed for different applications depending on the architecture, purpose, and scale. Here are the most common types of networks that utilize **LoRa radios**:

### 1. **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)**
   - **Description**: LoRaWAN is a **low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN)** protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated devices to the internet over long ranges. LoRaWAN networks operate in a **star topology** where end devices (nodes) communicate with gateways, which forward the data to a centralized server via the internet.
   - **Use Case**: IoT applications, such as smart agriculture, smart cities, industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, and utility metering.
   - **Key Feature**: The network requires **gateways** to relay data from end devices to a cloud server for processing.
   - **Examples**: The Things Network (TTN), commercial LoRaWAN networks from providers like Actility, Senet, and machineQ.

### 2. **Peer-to-Peer LoRa Networks**
   - **Description**: In a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** LoRa network, devices communicate **directly with each other** without the need for gateways or centralized infrastructure. This is typically done using LoRa radios in a simple point-to-point or point-to-multipoint setup.
   - **Use Case**: Local communication between devices without the need for internet access, useful in remote areas or where infrastructure is lacking.
   - **Key Feature**: No dependency on cloud or internet infrastructure. Ideal for small, localized networks.
   - **Examples**: Custom LoRa-based P2P communication setups, hobbyist projects using LoRa modules like SX1276.

### 3. **Mesh Networks Using LoRa**
   - **Description**: In a **LoRa mesh network**, each device acts as both a transmitter and a relay for messages. Devices (nodes) can communicate directly with nearby nodes, and messages can be relayed across multiple nodes to reach their destination. This can expand the network's range without the need for central infrastructure like gateways.
   - **Use Case**: Off-grid communication, where devices need to maintain communication over large areas without relying on centralized infrastructure. Commonly used in outdoor activities, disaster recovery, and military operations.
   - **Key Feature**: Network resilience and range extension through message relaying.
   - **Examples**: Meshtastic, RNode (LoRa Mesh), and LoRaMesh from various DIY projects and open-source implementations.

### 4. **LoRa Private Networks**
   - **Description**: These are **proprietary or private LoRa networks** typically set up by organizations or individuals for a specific use case, such as monitoring sensors across a farm, industrial complex, or campus. These networks may or may not use LoRaWAN, depending on the architecture.
   - **Use Case**: Applications like industrial monitoring, smart agriculture, and private environmental sensor networks.
   - **Key Feature**: Networks are set up and managed by an organization or individual, often tailored to specific needs.
   - **Examples**: Private LoRaWAN deployments by companies or local governments, private IoT sensor networks.

### 5. **Satellite-Based LoRa Networks**
   - **Description**: Satellite-based LoRa networks use **LoRa radios** to transmit data from remote areas directly to satellites equipped with LoRa receivers. The data is then relayed from the satellites to ground stations for further processing.
   - **Use Case**: Remote and hard-to-reach areas where traditional infrastructure is unavailable, such as environmental monitoring in the middle of the ocean, or tracking wildlife or equipment in isolated regions.
   - **Key Feature**: Global coverage through satellites, enabling communication in the most remote locations.
   - **Examples**: Lacuna Space, Swarm Technologies (for IoT).

### 6. **Star Topology LoRa Networks (Non-LoRaWAN)**
   - **Description**: In a simple **star topology**, end devices communicate directly with a central hub or gateway without the need for the full LoRaWAN protocol stack. This is similar to LoRaWAN but without the complexity of network management, and the data doesn't necessarily need to go to the internet.
   - **Use Case**: Localized IoT networks where devices report to a single base station or hub for local processing, such as a private sensor network on a farm or campus.
   - **Key Feature**: Simpler than LoRaWAN, with less overhead and a local focus.
   - **Examples**: Private setups using devices like LoRa gateways that do not connect to a cloud service.

### 7. **Ad-Hoc LoRa Networks**
   - **Description**: **Ad-hoc networks** using LoRa radios are temporary and dynamic. Devices can join or leave the network as needed, and there is no fixed infrastructure. These networks are typically used in temporary or emergency setups where fixed infrastructure is either not available or not feasible.
   - **Use Case**: Temporary networks for events, disaster recovery, or field research in remote locations.
   - **Key Feature**: Flexibility and ease of deployment, often using mesh or peer-to-peer communication.
   - **Examples**: Disaster recovery communication systems, temporary networks set up for outdoor events.

### 8. **LoRa PAN (Personal Area Network)**
   - **Description**: **LoRa Personal Area Networks (PAN)** are small-scale, local networks where devices communicate within close proximity using LoRa radios. These networks typically consist of wearable or portable devices that communicate locally without any need for long-range infrastructure.
   - **Use Case**: Personal communication, local sensor networks around a person or small group, or hobbyist projects.
   - **Key Feature**: Short-range, personal communication or data collection within a small geographic area.
   - **Examples**: Hobbyist projects, local environmental sensing or control networks.

### 9. **LoRa Broadcast Networks**
   - **Description**: In **LoRa broadcast networks**, messages are broadcasted to multiple devices in range without expecting a reply. This is useful for one-to-many communication where a central device needs to send updates or alerts to several devices simultaneously.
   - **Use Case**: Emergency alert systems, public information broadcasting, weather data broadcasting.
   - **Key Feature**: One-way communication from a central device to many receivers.
   - **Examples**: Simple LoRa-based broadcasting systems for weather alerts or remote sensor updates.

### 10. **Point-to-Point LoRa Networks**
   - **Description**: A **point-to-point (P2P)** LoRa network involves two devices communicating directly with each other over a set frequency. This type of network is commonly used in hobbyist projects or simple communication setups where only two devices are involved.
   - **Use Case**: Direct communication between two devices in remote areas, such as sending data between two sensors or a remote control system.
   - **Key Feature**: Direct, bidirectional communication between two LoRa devices.
   - **Examples**: Hobbyist point-to-point setups for remote control, telemetry, or sensor data transmission.

### Summary:
- **LoRaWAN**: For large-scale, cloud-connected IoT applications.
- **Peer-to-Peer LoRa Networks**: Simple, local device-to-device communication.
- **Mesh Networks Using LoRa**: Self-healing, range-extending networks where devices relay messages.
- **Private LoRa Networks**: Proprietary or local LoRa-based networks.
- **Satellite-Based LoRa Networks**: For global coverage in remote locations.
- **Star Topology LoRa Networks**: LoRa communication without full LoRaWAN infrastructure.
- **Ad-Hoc LoRa Networks**: Temporary, flexible networks for specific use cases.
- **LoRa PAN**: Short-range, personal area networks.
- **LoRa Broadcast Networks**: One-to-many communication.
- **Point-to-Point LoRa Networks**: Direct communication between two devices.

Each network type is tailored to specific use cases depending on the scale, complexity, and connectivity requirements. If you're working on a project, selecting the right network architecture will depend on whether you need local, off-grid communication or cloud-based data collection with global reach.
